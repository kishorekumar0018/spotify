# Spotify Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Spotify music data to derive insights about song popularity, trends, and key features. Using SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we explore various aspects of the dataset to understand the factors that influence song rankings on Spotify.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File Name**: `cleaned_dataset.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset contains various attributes related to Spotify songs, such as track name, artist, duration, popularity, and musical features like tempo, energy, and danceability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Oracle SQL**: Data extraction and transformation

## 📜 Queries & Syntax
The SQL queries used in this project are stored in the `spotify_db.sql` file. These queries perform operations such as:
- Retrieving the most popular songs
- Analyzing trends based on release years
- Finding correlations between song attributes and popularity
- Filtering songs based on specific criteria (e.g., genre, duration, energy levels)

## 📊 Key Insights
Some key findings from the analysis:
- Songs with higher energy and danceability tend to have better popularity scores.
- There is a correlation between release year and song popularity, with newer songs often ranking higher.
- Specific genres exhibit consistent trends in terms of their acoustic properties.

## 📈 Visualization
For a more detailed understanding, visualizations were created using Power BI. These charts and dashboards highlight:
- The top 10 most streamed songs
- Genre distribution analysis
- Popularity trends over time

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Load the dataset (`cleaned_dataset.csv`) into your SQL database.
2. Run the SQL queries from `spotify_db.sql` to extract insights.
3. Visualize the results using any BI tool if needed.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Expanding the dataset with more attributes.
- Implementing machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Creating an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration.
